his repository showcases a collection of Streamlit apps I've developed.

Description:

This project demonstrates various Streamlit applications, allowing users to explore the capabilities of this library. Each app has its own functionality and interface.

Features:

Easy Navigation: A sidebar menu helps users quickly switch between different apps.
Visual Representation: Each app has a corresponding image displayed in the main area.
Customizable: You can easily add or remove apps from the showcase.
Getting Started:

Prerequisites:

Python 3.x
Streamlit library (pip install streamlit)
Run the App:

Clone this repository or download the files.
Open a terminal in the project directory.
Run the command: streamlit run app_showcase.py (replace app_showcase.py with your actual file name)
Access the App:

A web app will launch in your default browser at http://localhost:8501.
Structure:

The apps folder should contain individual directories for each Streamlit app.
Each app directory should have its own Python script (e.g., app1.py, app2.py).
The app_showcase.py file manages the overall structure and displays the apps.
Adding Your Apps:

Create a separate directory for your new app within the apps folder.
Develop your app's functionality in a Python script within that directory.
Update the app_showcase.py file to include your new app's details.
